# Hailstorm
POC

# Installation
For now starting Hailstorm is as easy as:
```
make run
```

# Creating Hailstorm apps 
For the POC we only support applications written in Golang compiled with TinyGo. An example on how that works can be found in the `testdata` folder.

# Creating an application
Post to `/app` to create an Hailstorm application
```json
{
  "name": "My first app"
}
```

Should give you a response like this:
```json
{
  "id": "0744b007-681d-4473-8db5-1db9631de4df",
  "name": "My first app",
  "createAt": "2023-12-23T09:42:49.913529415+01:00"
}
```

# Deploying functions 
To deploy a function you post a binary WASM blob to `/app/{id}/deploy`. That will give you a response like this:
> There is an example Hailstorm app written in Go in the `testdata` folder.
```json
{
  "id": "a40fafe4-8b67-4c4a-992c-a34590c227e5",
  "appId": "0744b007-681d-4473-8db5-1db9631de4df",
  "createdAt": "2023-12-23T09:45:21.526261201+01:00"
}
```

Your function should be reachable on `/proxy/{deploy_id}`
